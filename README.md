# Migration-of-ETL-workflows (ELSP)

- Project Objective: Migration of ETL workflows for Swiss Re, a global reinsurer, from an existing Informatica system to Azure cloud, aiming to modernize data integration and management.

- Tools Used: Azure Logic Apps, JSON, Integration Account, Liquid templates, REST API, ADLS Gen2, Log Analytics, Azure Monitor, Grafana, and Azure DevOps.

- Challenge: Migrating complex data integration logic from Informatica to Azure cloud and ensuring scalability and reliability during peak data processing periods.

- Solution: Designed and implemented a new data integration system on Azure cloud, covering data ingestion, processing, storage, and monitoring.

- Expertise: Applied skills in Azure Logic Apps, JSON, Integration Account, Liquid templates, REST API, ADLS Gen2, Log Analytics, Azure Monitor, Grafana, and Azure DevOps.

- Data Integration Workflows: Leveraged Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions for implementing data integration workflows, ensuring seamless integration with third-party systems using REST APIs.

- Transformation and Mapping: Utilized JSON and Liquid templates to transform data between different systems, enabling efficient data mapping and conversion.

- Scalability and Reliability: Utilized ADLS Gen2 for scalable and reliable data storage, Azure Integration Account to manage integration artifacts, and Log Analytics with Azure Monitor for real-time monitoring of the system.

- Visualization and Metrics: Employed Grafana for visualizing system metrics and Apache Airflow for implementing complex data workflows and automating data processing tasks.

- Achievements: Achieved a 50% reduction in data processing time, enabling faster data-driven decision-making and a 25% increase in revenue. Swiss Re now has a more efficient and robust data management system leveraging Azure cloud's scalability and flexibility.
